# myLittleWebsite Core Principles

Personal website for data organization, portfolio, and technical learning. All work follows these principles.

---

## 1. Reason-First

- **Every addition, removal, or change must have a reason**
- State "why is this needed?" before working
- Leave intent and context in comments/docs when changing code or features

---

## 2. Self-Documentation

- The website **must have a section that explains itself**
- Include:
  - What this website is (purpose, audience)
  - How it was built and why (tech stack, structure, decisions)
  - Summary of maintenance and updates
- Maintain via README, /about, CHANGELOG, or a dedicated docs page

---

## 3. Always Extensible

- **Adding, removing, or changing things should be easy at any time**
- Design so that new features don’t require heavy changes to existing code
- Apply:
  - Separation of concerns: clear boundaries for features, components, styles
  - Modularity: independent modules/components, clear dependencies
  - Config/metadata-driven: new content or sections can be added via configuration
- Prefer structure that asks "what if we add this later?"

---

## Checklist Before Work

- [ ] Can you **explain why** this change is needed?
- [ ] Will the self-documentation reflect this change (or is it planned)?
- [ ] Can this structure still support adding new features?
