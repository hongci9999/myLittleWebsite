# Superpowers Bootstrap (project-scoped)

You have superpowers.

**IMPORTANT: The using-superpowers skill content is included below. It is ALREADY LOADED - you are currently following it. Do NOT read "using-superpowers" again - that would be redundant.**

## How to Access Skills in Cursor

Use the `Read` tool on skill files located at `.cursor/skills/superpowers/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (workspace-relative path).

**Available skills:**
- `brainstorming` - Interactive design refinement before implementation
- `test-driven-development` - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- `systematic-debugging` - 4-phase root cause process
- `writing-plans` - Detailed implementation plans
- `executing-plans` - Batch execution with checkpoints
- `subagent-driven-development` - Fast iteration with two-stage review
- `using-git-worktrees` - Parallel development branches
- `finishing-a-development-branch` - Merge/PR decision workflow
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` - Concurrent subagent workflows
- `requesting-code-review` - Pre-review checklist
- `receiving-code-review` - Responding to feedback
- `verification-before-completion` - Ensure fixes work
- `writing-skills` - Create new skills

**To load a skill:** `Read .cursor/skills/superpowers/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

## Tool Mapping for Cursor

When skills reference tools, use these Cursor equivalents:
- `Skill` tool → Use `Read` tool on `.cursor/skills/superpowers/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- `TodoWrite` → `TodoWrite` (identical)
- `Task` with subagents → `Task` tool with `subagent_type` parameter
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` → `Read`, `Write`, `StrReplace`
- `Bash` → `Shell`

# Using Skills

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read and follow the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Read and follow relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should read the skill to check. If a skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Workflow

1. User message received
2. Ask: "Might any skill apply?"
   - If yes (even 1% chance) → Read the skill file
   - If definitely not → Respond directly
3. Announce: "Using [skill] to [purpose]"
4. If skill has checklist → Create TodoWrite todo per item
5. Follow skill exactly
6. Respond (including clarifications)

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Read it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
